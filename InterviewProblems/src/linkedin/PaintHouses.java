/**
 * Paint House
 * 
 * Given a list of houses and the cost of painting each house, the houses can be
 * painted in three colors RED, GREEN and BLUE, two neighboring houses canâ€™t be
 * painted in the same color, calculate the total minimum cost for painting all
 * houses.
 *
 */
/*
 * 1) Dynamic programming problem.
 * 
 * 2)Maintain an 2D array of called min_cost, each column represent a color and
 * each row represent a houses.
 * 
 * 3) min_cost[i][0] represents that, when the i-th house is painted Red, the
 * min cost of 0-th to i-th houses. Thus we have the following:
 * 
 * //since the current color cannot be the same as the previous one
 * 
 * min_cost{i} = min(
 * 
 * cost[i][R] + min(cost{i-1, B}, cost{i-1, G}),
 * 
 * cost[i][B] + min(cost{i-1, R}, cost{i-1, G}),
 * 
 * cost[i][G] + min(cost{i-1, R}, cost{i-1, B}) )
