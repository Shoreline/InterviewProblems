/**
 * 
 * Often, we want to encode raw IDs in our database by hiding them behind some
 * 2-way decodeable hash. So, a URL which would have at one time been:
 * 
 * https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/848662
 * 
 * becomes
 * 
 * https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/kljJJ324hjkS_
 * 
 * We decode the ID kljJJ324hjkS_ to 848662 on our backend and serve the
 * relevant content. at some point, we start getting 404 errors from clients
 * requesting a certain URL of the form
 * 
 * https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/kljjj324hjks_
 * 
 * This can happen if certain clients, email services, or url shorteners "
 * sanitize" the url. Unfortunately, this change breaks decoding and the
 * resource cannot be found. To assess how big of a deal this is, we may want to
 * recover the IDs of the targets that were 404ing.
 * 
 * Your task: Given a method decode(testEncStr) which will return the decoded
 * int id if testEncStr is decodeable or will throw an exception or return null
 * ( depending on the language) if not, implement a new method decodeFind(String
 * badEncStr) which takes a string and returns the decoded int id.
