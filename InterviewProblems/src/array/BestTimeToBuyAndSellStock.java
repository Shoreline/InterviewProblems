/**
 * Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
 * 
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock
 * on day i.
 * 
 * If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one
 * and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum
 * profit.
 * 
 * Equivalent to: Find i and j that maximizes Aj ï¿½C Ai, where i < j.
