/**
 * Two players play a game. In this game, there are two piles of identical
 * stones. The number of stones in first pile is A and the number of stones in
 * second pile is B. There is also a positive integer constant K which is a
 * parameter to the game. It stays fixed throughout the game. The players
 * alternate taking turns. When a player's turn comes, that player first selects
 * a pile and then picks any number of stones from that pile - he has to pick at
 * least 1 stone and cannot pick more than K stones. The person who picks the
 * last stone loses. Write a method to determine if player 1 has a winning
 * strategy given A, B & K - assume both players play optimally.
